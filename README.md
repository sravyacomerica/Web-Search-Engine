• Uses the user input to search for the relevant documents based on the given word, it makes use an efficent computer algorithm to speed up the search process and efficient data structures such as hash maps to store the data.

• It also sorts the documents based on their similarity by assigning ranks to them. Calculates the precision and recall of the retrieved documents to compare it's perfomance.
